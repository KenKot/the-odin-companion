Global scope is created when a variable is declared outside of a function. Local scope is created when a variable is declared inside a function. Variables declared in global scope are accessible everywhere in the program. Variables declared in local scope are only accessible inside the function where they are declared. \n\nES6 introduced the let keyword, which allows variables to be declared with block scope. This means that variables declared with let are only accessible inside the block where they are declared."

              "answer": "There are three common Big O Notations:\n\nO(1), O(log n), and O(n).\n\nO(1) means that the time complexity is constant, regardless of the input size. O(log n) means that the time complexity is logarithmic, meaning it will increase at a slower rate as the input size increases. O(n) means that the time complexity is linear, meaning it will increase at the same rate as the input size increases."

              "question": "Why use Big O?",
              "answer": "There are a few reasons to use Big O notation:\n\n1. To describe the runtime of an algorithm.\n2. To compare the efficiency of two algorithms.\n3. To predict the behavior of an algorithm as the input size grows."

              "question": "What is Big Omega and why isn’t it as useful?",
              "answer": "Big Omega is a way of measuring the efficiency of an algorithm. It is the asymptotic upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. While it is useful in determining the efficiency of an algorithm, it is not as useful in determining the actual running time of an algorithm, since the actual running time may be different from the asymptotic upper bound."

              "question": "What are some different ways to rewrite history?",
              "answer": "There are several ways to rewrite history in Git, such as using 'git rebase', 'git reset', 'git cherry-pick', and 'git filter-branch'. These commands allow you to modify the commit history, reorder commits, squash or split commits, and more."

              "answer": "A safe way to push history changes to a remote repository is by using 'git push --force-with-lease'. This option ensures that you don't overwrite changes made by others unknowingly, as it will only allow the push if the remote branch matches your expectations."

              "answer": "The dangers of history-changing operations in Git include the potential to lose commits permanently, introduce conflicts, and disrupt collaboration with other team members. It is crucial to use these operations with caution and communicate changes to the team."

              "question": "What are best practices of history-changing operations?",
              "answer": "Some best practices for history-changing operations in Git are to avoid rewriting history on shared branches, create backup branches before making significant changes, and communicate with your team about any history modifications you plan to perform."

              "question": "Explain what it means for branches to be pointers.",
              "answer": "In Git, branches are simply pointers to specific commits in the repository. When you create a new commit on a branch, the branch pointer moves forward to the new commit. Multiple branches can point to the same commit, and they can diverge and merge as development progresses."

              "question": "Can you directly send your changes to a repository that you don’t own/have write access to?",
              "answer": "No, you cannot directly send your changes to a repository that you don't own or have write access to. Instead, you can fork the repository, make your changes in your fork, and then create a pull request to propose your changes to the original repository. The repository owner can review your changes and choose to accept or reject the pull request."

              "question": "What should you do immediately before merging your feature branch into main?",
              "answer": "Before merging your feature branch into the main branch, it is essential to ensure that your feature branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from the main branch. You can do this by performing a 'git pull' on the main branch to fetch and merge the latest changes into your local repository. This helps prevent conflicts and ensures a smooth merge."

              "answer": "Tightly coupled code refers to a situation where two or more components in a system are strongly dependent on each other. Changes in one component may require modifications in other tightly connected components, making the codebase less flexible and harder to maintain."

              "question": "What are the two requirements for a function to be pure?",
              "answer": "For a function to be pure, it must satisfy two requirements: 1) It should always produce the same output for the same input, and 2) It must not cause any side effects, such as modifying global state or external resources."
            },
            {
              "question": "What are side effects and why is it important to identify them when testing a function?",
              "answer": "Side effects are any changes a function makes to the outside world beyond the scope of the function itself, such as modifying variables outside its scope or making network calls. Identifying side effects is crucial when testing a function because it helps ensure that the function behaves as expected and does not have unintended consequences on the system."

              "question": "What are two solutions to the tightly coupled code problem?",
              "answer": "Two solutions to the tightly coupled code problem are Dependency Injection and the use of interfaces or abstractions. Dependency Injection allows components to declare their dependencies explicitly, making it easier to replace or mock those dependencies for testing. Interfaces or abstractions allow components to interact through well-defined contracts, reducing direct dependencies on concrete implementations."

            {
              "question": "What is mocking?",
              "answer": "Mocking is a technique used in testing to create objects that simulate the behavior of real objects in a controlled way. Mocks are often used to replace external dependencies or complex objects during testing, allowing developers to isolate and test specific parts of the system in isolation."
            },
            {
              "question": "When would you use a mock function?",
              "answer": "You would use a mock function when you need to simulate the behavior of a real function or object to isolate the code under test from external dependencies. Mock functions allow you to control the behavior of the mocked object and focus on testing the logic inside the function being tested."

            {
              "question": "How should you test incoming query messages?",
              "answer": "You should test incoming query messages by writing tests that set up the expected query and the expected response, then invoke the relevant function or API and compare the actual response with the expected response using appropriate Jest matchers."
            },
            {
              "question": "Why should you not test implementation?",
              "answer": "Testing implementation details can make the tests brittle and tightly coupled to the codebase, making it harder to refactor or modify the implementation without breaking the tests. It is better to test the behavior and functionality of the code rather than its specific implementation details."
            },
            {
              "question": "Should you test private methods?",
              "answer": "In general, it is not recommended to test private methods directly. Private methods are implementation details and should be tested indirectly by testing the public methods that utilize these private methods. Testing public methods ensures that the expected behavior is correctly achieved through the private methods."
            },
            {
              "question": "Why should you not test messages with no side effects?",
              "answer": "Testing messages with no side effects can be unnecessary and add overhead to the testing process without providing significant benefits. Such messages typically have straightforward behavior and do not require extensive testing, as there are no complex interactions with external systems or state changes to validate."
